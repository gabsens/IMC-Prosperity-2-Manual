    "# Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "With a large school of goldfish visiting, an opportunity arises to acquire some top grade `SCUBA_GEAR`. You only have two chances to offer a good price. Each one of the goldfish will accept the lowest bid that is over their reserve price. You know there’s a constant desire for scuba gear on the archipelago. So, at the end of the round, you’ll be able to sell them for 1000 SeaShells a piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst not every goldfish has the same reserve price, you know the distribution of their reserve prices. The reserve price will be no lower than 900 and no higher than 1000. The probability scales linearly from 0 at 900 to most likely at 1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "You only trade with the goldfish. Bids of other participants will not affect your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think hard about how you want to set your two bids in order to walk away with some serious SeaShell profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $n$ denote the number of fish and assume each fish has a single unit of scuba gear to sell.  \n",
    "For each $i\\in \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$, fish $i$ has a reserve price $R_i$: fish $i$ will sell its gear iff the bid $p$ verifies $p\\geq R_i$.\n",
    "Note that each $R_i$ is unknown to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Denoting by $p_l$, $p_h$ our low and high bid,\n",
    "the final profit is \n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^n (1000-p_l)1_{R_i \\leq p_l} + (1000-p_h)1_{p_l < R_i \\leq p_h} +  0\\times 1_{R_i > p_h},$$\n",
    "and our task is to choose our bids in order to maximize this sum, or equivalently, to maximize the average \n",
    "$$A \\coloneqq \\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^n (1000-p_l)1_{R_i \\leq p_l} + (1000-p_h)1_{p_l < R_i \\leq p_h}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $n$ is assumed to be large and since we know the distribution of the $R_i$, \n",
    "a heuristic suggested by the law of large numbers is to maximize the expected value $\\mathbb E[A]$.  \n",
    "Assuming the $R_i$ are i.i.d. with same distribution as $R$, the optimization problem is to maximize\n",

    "the distribution of reserve prices is continuous.   \n",
    "The pdf of $R$ writes therefore as $f_R(r) = (\\alpha r + \\beta)1_{900\\leq r\\leq 1000}$ for some constants $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.  \n",
