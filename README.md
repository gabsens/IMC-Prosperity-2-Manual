# Manual trading challenges in IMC Prosperity 2

IMC Trading ran the second edition of the [Prosperity challenge](https://prosperity.imc.com/) in April 2024.
It was made up of 5 rounds, each having an algorithmic and a manual trading challenge.

This repository contains my detailed write-ups for the manual trading challenges.  
The problems were mathematical in nature, mostly involving probability and optimization.

The notebooks are fully self-contained and are thus also accessible to people who did not take part in this contest (e.g., future contestants).

My final standing on the leaderboard for manual challenges was [30](https://i.imgur.com/azVc9nI.png) out of 9139 teams.
